# Future Project?

Think I wanna build some type of news headline/article R Shiny app that allows you to search for a term or phrase and return instances of it in news headlines and/or articles. A bunch of examples have motivated me to build this, as has listening to the media criticism podcast [Citations Needed](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/):

- [Enemy Epithets](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-137-thought-terminating-enemy-epithets-part-i) (Citations Needed) -- US media has a unique way of referring to Official Enemies, and it'd be fun to take a historical look at the use of these epithets in headlines and articles.
- Confirm the reported erosion of the use of "landlord" in favor of terms like "housing-provider"
